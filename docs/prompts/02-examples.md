Generate practical examples for grove-docgen that demonstrate increasing complexity:

## Requirements
Create three distinct examples showing how to use grove-docgen for documentation generation:

1. **Example 1: Basic Setup** - Setting up grove-docgen for a simple project
2. **Example 2: Advanced Configuration** - Complex documentation with multiple sections and custom settings
3. **Example 3: Grove Ecosystem Integration** - Documentation generation as part of Grove development workflows

## Structure
For each example, provide:
- Complete docgen.config.yml examples
- Sample prompt files and their purposes
- Commands to generate documentation
- Expected output structure

## Context Integration
Reference how grove-docgen works within the Grove ecosystem:
- Integration with grove-meta for unified tooling
- Using grove-context for enhanced documentation generation
- Workflow integration with other Grove tools

Focus on practical examples that show how to create comprehensive, AI-generated documentation that maintains quality and consistency across projects.
